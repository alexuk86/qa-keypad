#+TITLE: Wemos QA keypad

* Device install

To setup a new device you can use the arduino software, you will need a plugin to upload the files in the =data= folder to your wemos device.

* Device Setup

When switching on the device for the first time it will launch in access point mode to allow you to setup the device, connect to =weeeecfg= from a phone and enter password =weeeecfg= to setup the device. If the device can not connect to a local network it will relaunch the setup interface.

subsequent usage of the device will reuse the same settings as long as the device can connect.

The interfacing is using a simple web interface generated from this repository.

* Later
** TODO gzip the html

The wemos is by no means fast so gzip so there is less data to send.
